This repository just contains the PLC code I use to run WinCNC based CNC machine.
It handles the I/O signals and safety (including things like ATC), as well as controlling a vacuum over
ModBUS.

I just like to revision control it, i'm sure it's worthless to most people, but feel free to ping me if you have questions!
